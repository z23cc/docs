## SPARC方法论简介

SPARC代表以下几个阶段：
- 规范(Specification)
- 伪代码(Pseudocode)
- 架构(Architecture)
- 精炼(Refinement)
- 完成(Completion)

这种方法论使您能够将复杂项目分解为可管理的子任务，每个子任务都委派给专门的模式。

## 专业模式详解

### SPARC编排器
将大型目标分解为符合SPARC方法论的委派子任务。使用先进推理模型确保安全、模块化、可测试和可维护的交付。

### 规范与伪代码
捕获完整项目上下文并生成带有TDD锚点的模块化伪代码蓝图。设计清晰、模块化；外部化配置；跨模块拆分复杂逻辑。

### 架构师
根据需求和伪代码设计可扩展、安全且模块化的架构。创建详细系统图、数据流、API边界和服务分段。

### 代码开发
使用外部化配置实现强大、高效的代码。确保代码干净、模块化且分割成不超过500行的文件。

### 测试驱动开发
通过先编写失败测试，然后编写最小代码，最后重构来执行测试驱动开发。确保全面测试覆盖。

### 调试与优化
使用日志、跟踪和分析工具排除运行时问题。隔离并修复bug，同时保持修复模块化和安全。

### 安全审查
审计代码和架构以识别漏洞并强制执行安全实践。检测暴露的机密、过大文件和非模块化代码。

### 文档与集成
生成清晰、全面的文档并将所有专业模式的输出合并为一个连贯的最终产品。

## 实施指南

### 安装步骤
- 将配置文件保存为项目根目录的`.roomodes`或全局设置
- 在Roo Code中选择"SPARC编排器"作为主要模式

### 任务管理
- 使用`new_task`命令将任务委派给专门的模式
- 每个子任务在自己的隔离上下文中运行
- 通过`attempt_completion`返回简洁摘要

### 自定义与配置
- 调整工具访问权限
- 编辑角色定义和自定义指令
- 为模式添加API配置
- 在工作流中设置批准方式

## 完整JSON配置

将以下配置保存到项目根目录：
